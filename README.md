A challenge made for Capture the Flag events (CTFs) to challenge a particpants understanding of computer networking, data analysis and basic mathmatical figures. 

In this challenge a particpant is required to connect to a specified port and ip where they are presented with various menus that provide the goal of the challenge and the required information to complete it.

Good luck and have fun (:
